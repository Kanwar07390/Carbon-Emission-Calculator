# Carbon-Emission-Calculator
# 🌱 Carbon Emission Calculator (C++)

A simple console-based mini project in C++ that estimates an individual's **annual carbon footprint** based on:
- Transportation mode and daily travel distance  
- Monthly electricity usage  
- Food preference (Veg/Non-Veg)

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Calculates CO2 emissions from transport, electricity, and diet.
- Gives sustainability suggestions based on total emission.
- Saves results automatically in a text file (`carbon_data.txt`).
- Uses C++ functions, conditionals, and file handling.

## 🧩 Example Output
carbon_data.txt
nter distance travelled daily (in km): 15
Enter transport mode (car/bus/bike/bicycle/walk): car
Enter monthly electricity usage (in kWh): 120
Enter food preference (veg/nonveg): veg

Calculating your annual carbon footprint...

Transport Emission : 1149.00 kg CO2/year
Electricity Emission : 1224.00 kg CO2/year
Food Emission : 500.00 kg CO2/year
Total Carbon Emission : 2873.00 kg CO2/year
Your emission level is Moderate. Good job!
